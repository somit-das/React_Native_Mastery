## so react native making "height: '20%'" of a component in a parant  making other components partial showing beacause height  of parent was not set and to make meant 20% of screen we have to set parent component to height. we have to set   height:screenHeight and const screenHeight = Dimensions.get('window').height;

Exactly right — let’s break it down and confirm your understanding step by step:

---

### ✅ Your Situation:

You wrote something like:

```jsx
<View style={{ height: '20%', width: '100%' }} />
```

But it caused **other components to be partially shown or misaligned**. Why?

---

### 🧠 The Core Reason:

* `height: '20%'` in **React Native** means “20% of the parent’s height” ✅
* If the **parent has no height set**, then React Native **doesn’t know what 20% is**, so layout gets messed up ❌

---

### ✅ Correct Interpretation:

> “React Native is making the component take 20% of the parent's height. But since the parent’s height isn’t defined, the result is broken layout — other components look partially shown or overlap.”

---

### 🛠️ How to Fix It

#### ✅ If you meant “20% of the screen”:

You **must** define the parent’s height first using `Dimensions`:

```js
import { Dimensions } from 'react-native';

const screenHeight = Dimensions.get('window').height;
```

Then in your component:

```jsx
<View style={{ height: screenHeight }}>
  <View style={{ height: '20%', backgroundColor: 'red' }} />
  <View style={{ height: '80%', backgroundColor: 'blue' }} />
</View>
```

✅ Now `height: '20%'` is 20% of the full screen.

---

### 🧩 Visual Analogy:

Think of a room (the parent container) where you want to place a table that's **20% as tall as the room**.

* 🏠 If the room has **no defined height**, how can you measure **20% of it**? You can’t.
* 📏 But if you say “this room is 300cm tall,” now **20% of 300cm = 60cm** — so the table has a proper size.

### ✅ Alternative: Use Flex

If you're building a layout based on proportions, and you want to avoid using exact pixel heights, you can also use `flex`:

```jsx
<View style={{ flex: 1 }}>
  <View style={{ flex: 0.2, backgroundColor: 'red' }} />
  <View style={{ flex: 0.8, backgroundColor: 'blue' }} />
</View>
```

* `flex: 0.2` means 20% of available space
* `flex: 0.8` means 80% of available space
* No need to manually calculate screen height

### ✅ Summary (Sticky Note Style)

| Goal                     | What to Do                                                                                      |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Want `20%` of screen     | Use `Dimensions.get('window').height * 0.2` OR wrap inside a parent with `height: screenHeight` |
| Want `20%` of parent     | Use `height: '20%'` — but **make sure parent has height**                                       |
| Want proportional layout | Use `flex` (e.g., `flex: 0.2`)                                                                  |
