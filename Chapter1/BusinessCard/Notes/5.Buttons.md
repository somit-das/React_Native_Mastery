# 5. Buttons

React Native has a `<Button />` component, that provides access to a native button. 

Let’s import it first

```jsx
import { Button } from 'react-native';
```

Let’s define a function inside our App component, that will be called when we press the button

```jsx
export default function App() {
	const contactMe = () => {
		console.warn("Contact me pressed");
	};
	
	...
}
```

Now, let’s render the “Contact me” button

```jsx
<Button title="Contact me" onPress={contactMe} />
```

Now, we should see a Native button at the bottom of the screen. They will look different on Android (left) and on iOS (right). That’s not a bug - that’s a feature. That’s the Native Button component, that Android and iOS users are familiar with.

When we press it, we should see a small popup saying “Contact me pressed”. That means that we linked the button correctly with the function. 

### Linking

We can actually implement the functionality of the Contact Me button, by opening the email client with your email address pre-filled. 

To do that, we can use the Linking API. Import it from react-native:

```jsx
import { Linking } from 'react-native';
```

And then, update the `contactMe` function:

```jsx
const contactMe = () => {
  Linking.openURL("mailto:vadim@notjust.dev");
};
```

ℹ️ This might throw an error, if the device you are testing on, doesn’t have an email client app.
