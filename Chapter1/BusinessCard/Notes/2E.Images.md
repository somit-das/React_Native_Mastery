# But using AspectRatio some how worked without using height and setting like this 
```js style={{
                // height: '20%',
                width: '100%',
                aspectRatio:16/9
              }}
``` // works no other component gets hidden
but setting this style . After sometime adding somany component will the other component gets hidden due to not setting parent height

You're absolutely right to be curious — and you're asking a **very smart question**. Let’s explore **why `aspectRatio` works**, and **whether it can cause issues later if the parent has no height**.

---

## 🔍 First, What `aspectRatio` Does in React Native

When you set:

```js
style={{
  width: '100%',
  aspectRatio: 16 / 9,
}}
```

You're telling React Native:

> "Make this component's **height automatically** based on its width, keeping the width-to-height ratio as 16:9."

✅ So if the width is 300px, height becomes `300 * (9/16) = 168.75px`.

---

## 💡 Why This Works Without `height`

* Unlike `height: '20%'`, which **depends on the parent having a height**, `aspectRatio` **calculates its own height from the width**.
* And width in React Native (especially `width: '100%'`) is often based on **screen width**, so this gives the component a stable and predictable size.

✅ This is why your layout **doesn’t break**, even without explicitly setting parent height.

## ⚠️ But… Can `aspectRatio` Cause Issues Later?

### Short answer: **Yes, maybe — in some specific scenarios.**

Here's when it **might** break things:

| Situation                                                                  | Problem                                                                                                                                 |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🔁 You nest components deeply                                              | Eventually you may place a component inside a container that doesn’t have width or height — then aspectRatio can't calculate properly.  |
| 📱 On different screen sizes or when rotating                              | If you rely too heavily on aspectRatio for layout instead of `flex` or fixed dimensions, it may get tricky to manage responsive design. |
| 🧱 If you mix aspectRatio with `flexDirection: row` or overlapping layouts | It may produce unexpected results without testing thoroughly.                                                                           |

## ✅ Best Practice Summary

| Use Case                                               | Recommended Style                                 |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| 🖼️ Want a fixed visual shape (like an image or video) | Use `aspectRatio` (e.g., `16/9`, `1/1`)           |
| 📐 Want to divide space proportionally                 | Use `flex`                                        |
| 🎯 Want a box to be a % of screen                      | Use `Dimensions.get('window').height * 0.2`       |
| 🧩 Complex layouts with siblings                       | Make sure **parents have defined height or flex** |

---

### ✅ Visual Tip:

If you're stacking components **vertically**, using `flex` or `ScrollView` is safer long-term. Here's a clean pattern:

```js
<View style={{ flex: 1 }}>
  <View style={{ aspectRatio: 16 / 9, width: '100%' }} />   // Video/Image banner
  <View style={{ flex: 1 }}>                               // Other scrollable content
    <ScrollView>
      {/* All your content goes here */}
    </ScrollView>
  </View>
</View>
```

### 🔧 Rule of Thumb

> ✔ If your layout uses `aspectRatio`, make sure at least **width** is known.
> ❌ But don’t mix too many `aspectRatio` components inside containers without defined sizes — it **can** cause future layout bugs.
