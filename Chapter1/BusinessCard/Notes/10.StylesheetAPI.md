# 10. StyleSheet API

So far, we have seen how we can style our UI with inline styles. Example:

```jsx
<Image style={{ height: 150, aspectRatio: 16 / 9, borderRadius: 10 }} />
```

That’s perfectly fine for small components where we don’t have a lot of markup code. However, as our components grow in size, it is advisable to separate the rendering code from the styling code.

We can do that by extracting the styles into a StyleSheet. 

## StyleSheet

To extract the styles from the rendering logic, we can use the `StyleSheet` from `react-native`

Let’s import it first

```
import { StyleSheet } from 'react-native';
```

And define our styles just below our QuestionCard component.

```jsx
const styles = StyleSheet.create({

})
```

Now, inside the StyleSheet, we can define all our style objects. Let’s go ahead and write the styles for the image and the name of our `ProjectCard`. The name of this object is arbitrary, chosen by you. 

```jsx
const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  image: { 
	  height: 150, 
	  aspectRatio: 16 / 9, 
	  borderRadius: 10 
  },

  name: {
		fontWeight: 'bold',
    fontSize: 20,
    color: 'dimgray',
    marginTop: 10,
  },
});

```

Now that we have these objects, we can send them to the `style` prop of our components

```jsx
<View>
  <Image source={image} style={styles.image} />
  <Text style={styles.name}>{name}</Text>
</View>
```

ℹ️ Pay attention that when we send the style object, we no longer need `{{ }}` double braces. That’s because the `styles.image` is already an object.
