why in react native making "height: '20%'" of a component in a parant  making other components partial showing but i meant 20%of screen or parent component.

```jsx
<View style={styles.container}>
            <Image source={{
              uri: "https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1605379399642-870262d3d051?q=80&w=3006&auto=format&fit=crop&ixlib=rb-4.1.0&ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8fA%3D%3D"
            }}
              style={{
                height: '20%',
                width: '100%',
                // aspectRatio:16/9
              }}
            />

            .............
            .............
            .............
</View>
```
In React Native, when you use:

```js
height: '20%'
```

…it **doesn't always mean** "20% of the screen height." It actually means:

👉 **"20% of the height of the parent container"** — but **only if that parent has an explicit height** set.

---

### 🔍 Why your component is *partially showing*:

If the parent of your component doesn't have a defined height, then `'20%'` of "undefined" becomes ambiguous or zero. This leads to layout issues like:

* The component being squished or partially rendered
* Siblings overlapping or not showing properly

---

### ✅ Solution 1: Use screen height explicitly

If you meant "20% of the screen", import the screen height like this:

```js
import { Dimensions } from 'react-native';

const screenHeight = Dimensions.get('window').height;

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  myBox: {
    height: screenHeight * 0.2, // 20% of screen
    width: '100%',
  },
});
```

This guarantees your box is always 20% of the screen.

---

### ✅ Solution 2: Use `flex` instead of `height: '20%'`

If your layout is flex-based, and you're trying to proportion space within a column or row, prefer:

```js
flex: 0.2
```

This means "take 20% of the parent’s space" — **as long as the parent uses `flex: 1` or has a defined height.**

---

### 👣 Quick Checklist for such issues:

1. ❓ Does the parent container have a `height` or `flex: 1`?
2. 🧮 Are you intending "20% of screen" or "20% of parent"?
3. 🧱 Are other siblings using conflicting layout styles (e.g., `position: absolute`, or overlapping margins)?

### 🎯 Best Practices

| Goal                     | Best Way                                            |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
| 20% of **screen height** | Use `Dimensions.get('window').height * 0.2`         |
| 20% of **parent height** | Use `flex: 0.2`, and ensure parent has `flex`       |
| Consistent layout        | Use `SafeAreaView`, `ScrollView`, and `flex` wisely |
