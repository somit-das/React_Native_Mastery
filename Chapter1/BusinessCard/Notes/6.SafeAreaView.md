# 6. Safe Area View

Previously, all phone screens were plain rectangles, that we could use to render content. 

Now, most phones have notches for cameras and sensors, and other elements on the screen, that can impact the visibility of our UI on the screen. 

As mobile developers, we should be aware of this, and render our UI accordingly. For some elements, like background images, we might want to extend them on the whole screen, even behind the notch area, but for content that should always be visible, we need to make sure it is rendered inside the Safe Area.

That’s where a `<SafeAreaView />`  component comes into play. React Native provides this component out of the box. When wrapping our content inside the `<SafeAreaView />`, we ensure that it will render in the area that is safe - meaning it won’t display behind the phone notch, if it exists.

It works by simply adding some padding on top and the bottom of the component, equal to the size of the notch if it exists. Here is a good representation, of a green background expanding on the whole screen, and a white Safe Area View.

However, the built-in `SafeAreaView` component that comes with React Native is quite limiting.

That’s where the 3rd party libraries, built by the community shine. 

# Safe Area Context

The `react-native-safe-area-context` is a more flexible library and provides more capabilities when it comes to working with Safe Area Views.

Let’s install it in our project by running:

```bash
npx expo install react-native-safe-area-context
```

<aside>
ℹ️ `npx expo install` is similar to `npm install` with the advantage of choosing the right version of the package that is compatible with the Expo SDK version your app is using.

- To use a safe area context, you need to add `SafeAreaProvider` in your app root component.

```bash
import { SafeAreaProvider } from 'react-native-safe-area-context';

function App() {
  return <SafeAreaProvider>...</SafeAreaProvider>;
}
```

Then, we can use the `SafeAreaView` anywhere in our app

```bash
import { SafeAreaView } from 'react-native-safe-area-context';

export default function App() {
  return (
    <SafeAreaProvider>
      <SafeAreaView edges={['bottom']}>
	      ...
			</SafeAreaView>
    </SafeAreaProvider>
  )
}
```

For more advanced use-cases, you can also get access to the size of the notches using:

```jsx
const insets = useSafeAreaInsets();
```
