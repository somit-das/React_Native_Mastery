# But using AspectRatio some how worked without using height and setting like this  style={{
                // height: '20%',
                width: '100%',
                aspectRatio:16/9
              }} works no other component gets hidden

Excellent observation — you're absolutely right! Using `aspectRatio` **does work** without setting an explicit `height`, and it **avoids breaking the layout**. Let’s dive into why that happens:

---

### ✅ What `aspectRatio` Does in React Native

```js
aspectRatio: 16 / 9
```

This means:

> “Keep the **width-to-height** ratio at **16:9**, and calculate the height automatically based on the width.”

---

### 🔍 Why This Works Even Without `height`

When you write:

```js
<View style={{ width: '100%', aspectRatio: 16 / 9 }} />
```

React Native says:

1. Width is 100% of the parent container ✅
2. Since `aspectRatio = width / height`, and width is known, it **auto-calculates the height** to maintain 16:9
3. No need to explicitly set the `height` or rely on a parent having a defined height 🎯

So layout doesn't break, and other components are not affected.

---

### 🔄 Behind the Scenes:

Let’s say your screen width is `360 pixels`.

With `aspectRatio: 16/9`, the height will be:

```js
height = width / aspectRatio = 360 / (16 / 9) = 202.5px
```

So it's as if you wrote:

```js
width: 360,
height: 202.5
```

...but React Native figures it out for you ✨

### ✅ Why Components Aren’t Hidden with `aspectRatio`

Because:

* You're not using percentage-based height (which depends on parent)
* You're giving a **concrete ratio** tied to a known width
* React Native can confidently calculate height — no surprises

### 🧠 Summary (Sticky Note Style)

| Style                        | Needs Parent Height? | Why It Might Break?                  | Good For                                       |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `height: '20%'`              | ✅ Yes                | Breaks if parent has no height       | Proportional layout inside fixed-height parent |
| `aspectRatio: 16 / 9`        | ❌ No                 | Never breaks, auto-calculates height | Responsive media, clean UI without height math |
| `height: screenHeight * 0.2` | ❌ No                 | Always works, but less responsive    | Screen-based layout                            |
| `flex: 0.2`                  | ✅ Yes                | Depends on parent using `flex`       | Dynamic layout sharing space                   |

### 📌 When to Use `aspectRatio`

* For images, videos, cards, banners — anything with a natural shape
* When you want to avoid using `Dimensions` or guessing height
* When you want **predictable height without breaking layout**

---

Let me know if you'd like a **sample layout** comparing:

* `height: '20%'`
* `aspectRatio: 16 / 9`
* `flex: 0.2`
  ...so you can see how they behave side-by-side visually.
