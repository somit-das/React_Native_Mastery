# But using AspectRatio some how worked without using height

Great observation — and yes, you're absolutely right! 🎯
**`aspectRatio`** *can* work even **without explicitly setting `height` or `width`**, and this is an important trick in React Native layout behavior.

Let’s unpack exactly **why and how** that works:

---

### 🔧 What is `aspectRatio` in React Native?

```js
aspectRatio: number
```

It sets the **ratio of width to height** of a component.

* `aspectRatio: 1` → width and height are equal (square)
* `aspectRatio: 2` → width is twice the height
* `aspectRatio: 0.5` → height is twice the width

---

### 🔍 Why `aspectRatio` "just works" even without height:

React Native layout system is **flexible**. When you use:

```js
<View style={{ width: '100%', aspectRatio: 2 }} />
```

You're saying:

> "I want the width to be 100% of the parent — and I want the height to automatically adjust so that width\:height = 2:1"

So:

* If width = 300, height is auto-calculated as 150
* No need to **manually specify height** anymore

📌 This *automatically fills the space properly* even if no height is set on the parent!

### ✅ Why this didn't break like `'20%'` height did:

| Property                 | Needs Parent Height? | Behavior                            |
| ------------------------ | -------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `height: '20%'`          | ✅ Yes                | Fails if parent height is undefined |
| `aspectRatio` + `width`  | ❌ No                 | Calculates height automatically     |
| `aspectRatio` + `height` | ❌ No                 | Calculates width automatically      |

So, **`aspectRatio` adapts intelligently**, while `'20%'` is relative and **needs context** (like parent height).

---

### 📐 Visual Intuition:

Imagine a photo frame:

* If you know the width (say 400px), and the photo is 4:3,
* Then height = 400 ÷ 4 × 3 = 300px

React Native applies the **same logic** using `aspectRatio`.

---

### 🧠 Memory Hook:

> 🧩 **Aspect Ratio = Autocalculated partner**
> Set one dimension (width or height), and the other is *calculated for you*.

---

### ⚠️ Gotchas:

* `aspectRatio` **doesn’t scroll** — if you want content that overflows (like text), you'll need to be careful.
* It works best for **images**, **videos**, or **container boxes** that need to **maintain shape**.

---

### ✅ TL;DR Summary

* ✅ `height: '20%'` breaks if parent height is not defined
* ✅ `aspectRatio` works without height — as long as **either width or height is defined**
* ✅ You can use `aspectRatio` for responsive, consistent layouts without hardcoding
